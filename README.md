📌 Notes for Students (Important)
⚠️ Avoid Copy-Paste Learning

Copying code may look fast, but it slows down actual learning.
To truly understand:

Read instructions carefully

Type the code manually

Experiment with changes

Test and debug on your own

Hands-on practice leads to deeper understanding. Keep coding! 💪
